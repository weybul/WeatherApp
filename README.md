# WeatherApp
I had some fun building this weather app, just like my previous project it was difficult to get started. mainly bcuz i had no idea what an api was and my weather app needed it to fetch
weather data from a server, i honestly had much more complex idea of an api in my mind. but as i began taking actions/writing code i quickly got hold of it. i switched through two apis
to obtain weather data from and settled with openweather's api, it seemed convinient and simple. i used another api in this project to retrieve the user's ip address, this took me a lot
of time like 6+ hours, nd it should not have, basically i initially went with an api that wasnt even providing such a service that i was lookin for, i kept changing my code thinking i 
must not b writing the code correctlty to get it working, looked for help, spent some time googling and going back to their website to see their documentation on apis, i even mailed them
when nothing had worked out and i had spent a lot of time aready. all through out it was in the back of my mind that mayb their api is at fault or something and mayb i should try changing
the api to a different one, but i did not cuz i thought there was something wrong with how i was using their api in my program. anyways when i did change the api to a differrent one with
the same code i had, it worked the very 1st time, another problem i had was with displaying gifs on the canvas acording to the weather detials, spent a reasonable time here too untill i
was able to make it work, over all this is the most fun i had buiding a project, and i could have mayb gone a little ahead with things in it, and also refine it a lil more but i already
had spent a full week at this and wanted to now move on to building the website which was the next thing i had in mind afer the weather app.

Features:
1. loads and displays weather data according to ur location if its turned on
2. can take a new place's name as input to display weather there
3. uses different animations to add to the interactivity of the program
4. has a clean and generally good looking gui
5. displays different icons according to the temprature, humidity, over all weather
6. has different gifs to demonstrate weather conditions

I encourage u to switch between various different locations to fully check out all different weather icons, background images especially gifs
and if u get any issues with gifs, try runnig the weather app directly through the terminal and not from a code editor
